## Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check [existing issues](https://github.com/AvarnitaSrivastava/Eatalyzer/issues) to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots if applicable
- Your environment (OS, browser, etc.)

## Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for enhancements. Please use the feature request template when opening an issue to suggest new features or improvements.

## Code Review Process

1. A maintainer will review your pull request and provide feedback.
2. You may be asked to make changes to your code.
3. Once all feedback has been addressed, your pull request will be merged.
